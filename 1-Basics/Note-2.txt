Note 4: Adept Keybindings
=========================

In this section, there will be a lot of different Vim keybindings. These are more for adept people, but beginners can definitely start memorizing them.
The keybindings are grouped into multiple different categories.

1. Undo and Redo
================
u: Undo Action
Ctrl+R: Redo Action

NOTE: You can mix and match numbers to dictate the number of time to run the Undo or Redo command.
For example, '3u' will run the Undo command 3 times.

2. Copy, Cut, Paste, Delete
===========================
d: Delete the Selection and Copies it into Buffer
dd: Delete entire line and Copies it into Buffer
D: Delete the REST of the line (starting from cursor)
y: Copy the Selection into Buffer
yy / Y: Copies the Entire Line into Buffer
c: Cut the Selection into Buffer (Won't delete the line like dd)
cc: Cuts the Entire Line into Buffer
C: Cut the REST of the line (starting from cursor)
p: Paste the Selection at the End of Line / A Line Above
P: Paste the Selection from the Beginning of Line / A Line Below

NOTE: Copying or Cutting in Vim does not copy it into the System clipboard.
NOTE: Similar to above, you can mix and match numbers with the keybind above to repeat it.
NOTE: Cuts directly enter you into Insert Mode

3. Replacing
============
r: Replace the selection with the next character you type
R: Enters "Replace" Mode



Note 5: Advanced Movement in Vim
================================
There are more ways to move in Vim. These are more precise methods of moving, providing you a better control on where you want to move.
Again all this in "Normal" mode.

w: Move to the start of the next word
W: Move to the start of the next word (Ignoring special characters / cases)
e: Move to the end of the next word
E: Move to the end of the next word (Ignoring special characters / cases)
b: Move to the start of the previous word
B: Move to the start of the previous word (Ignoring special characters / cases)
0: Jump to the Beginning of the Line
$: Jump to the End of the Line

NOTE: This movement can be combined with other keybindings such as Cut/Copy/Delete
For example, 'dw' means to delete up to the next word
Adding a number before it will repeat the command for the number stated



Note 6: Advanced Cut, Copy and Delete
=====================================
There are more ways to control what to delete and cut and this provides us a more refined control in changing configuring things.
There are the standard, highlight a section in Visual mode and pressing "c" or the keybind "cc" or "dd"
However, there are more ways than just those two.
By pressing "c", "d" or "y", followed by the values below. It will do different things:
iw: Inner word
aw: A word
iW: Inner WORD
aw: A WORD  
is: Inner sentence
as: A sentence
ib: Inner block (Anything between brackets)
ab: A block (Anything between brackets + brackets itself)
i': Between ''
i": Between ""
i(: Between ()
i{: Between {}

For example, 'daw' will form 'Delete a word', which deletes the selected word
'dw' deletes from the cursor to the next word, but if your cursor is located somewhere else, it will not delete the current word completely.
As such, 'daw' and 'diw' is preferred if you want to delete the currently highlighted word
'yib' will copy the entire block of text within the brackets.
