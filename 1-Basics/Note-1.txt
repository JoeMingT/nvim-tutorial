Note 1: Basics of Vim
=====================

Vim has plenty of things that comes with it in order to make it possible to do most things using purely the keyboard.
Vim starts with multiple modes. Each modes does their own things and have special things available only to them.
The modes in Vim includes:
1. Normal: Cannot edit anything. But allows you to use keybindings.
2. Insert: Allows editing / typing. Have some keybindings but very limited.
3. Command: Access to commands for NeoVim.
4. Visual: Allows for Selection of More than one Line.


Note 2: Entering Insert Mode
============================

There are multiple ways to enter Insert Mode. These are default keybindings from Vim.
To Enter Insert Mode you could type:
a: Insert starting right AFTER your cursor
A: Insert starting at the END of the Line
i: Insert starting AT your cursor
I: Insert starting at the BEGINNING of the line
o: Add a new line below and Insert starting from the new line
O: Add a new line above and Insert starting from the new line


Note 3: Moving in Vim
=====================

Similar to above, there are definitely multiple different ways to navigate around the Vim environment.
First of all, using mouse DOES NOT work as you are in a terminal. Unless you have some settings or plugin installed that allows the usage of mouse.
Furthermore, it's important to note that this is under the "Normal" mode context. In Insert mode, we will have other means to do so.
Now, to move around Vim, we can of course use the Arrow Keys.
However, a more efficient manner is to use the h, j, k, and l keys. 
h: Moves left
j: Moves down
k: Moves up
l: Moves right

Now, you may ask, how would I navigate multiple lines at once? 
We can do this by combining keybinds. We can press a number, followed by the direction.
This will navigate the cursor according to the number you have typed.
For example, '5j' will move down 5 times.

There are also some special type of movements, which I will list down below:
gg: Move to START OF FILE
G: Move to END OF FILE
